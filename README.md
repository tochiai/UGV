UGV: Unmanned Ground Vehicle
===

### Setting up:
To build a development environment on your own machine, run the following from your command line:

1. `cd directory/of/your/choice`
2. `git clone https://github.com/milotoor/UGV.git`
3. `cd UGV`
4. `npm update`

Note that these commands rely on you having already installed the [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) CLI (Command Line Interface).  Hopefully you know what git is. npm stands for Node Package Manager and is a package manager for JavaScript projects.  While our project is by no means exclusively JavaScript-driven, there will be a fair amount of it on the front-end, so if you plan on doing **_any_** front-end development (i.e. working on or making even the *slightest* alteration to that code, you will need it as well.  The `npm update` command will automatically download (locally) the packages that the site's build requires.
